# Power-Tools-Sharing-Server

### Background

Every building, every neighborhood, has people passionate about owning every power tool imaginable. 
These are expensive and almost never used. They should be shared.

### Challenge

Part of the reason why nobody is winning in this space is because the for-profit nature of these, 
bound to needing to lend these ites for money. Instead, build a non-for-profit sharing economy where 
individuals are just sharing without asking anything in return, around power tools, an app, site, etc.

### Current Status

Currently server exposes RESTful APIs for any user to register their account and do login for uploading their
power tools.

### Whats Next

Next development interation will include below items:
* REST API for users for uploading their power tools.
* REST API for users for marking their power tools as loaned.
* More functional test-cases and coverage.
* CI and CD.
* Remote web deployment.

### Technologies Used

* Java 8 - Language used for developing server application
* [Spring Framework](http://projects.spring.io/spring-framework/) 4.1.7 - Development framework for building web based application
* [Spring Data JPA](http://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-jpa/) - Development framework for managing data in datbase through web application
* PostgreSQL - Database provider for storing data
* [Spring Tool Suite](https://spring.io/tools) - IDE for project development
